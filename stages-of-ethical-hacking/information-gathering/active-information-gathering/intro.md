# Intro

* **Active information gathering** - is when you interact directly with a computer system in order to gather system specific information about the target. Unlike passive information gathering which relies on publicly available information, active information gathering relies on tools that will send different types of requests to the computer. The goal is to gather information about that device or other devices that are connected to it on the same network.
  * Active recon can be used to find out information such as open/closed ports, the OS of a machine, the services that are running, banner grabbing, discovering new hosts or find vulnerable applications on a host.
  * Discover:
    * Open ports
    * Learn about internal infrastructure
    * Enumerating information
