# Passive Information Gathering

* **Passive information gathering** - Passive recon is when you gather information about a target without directly interacting with the target. This means that you donâ€™t send any type of request to the target and therefore the target has no way of knowing that you are gathering information on them.
  * Generally passive information gathering uses public resources that have information on that target.
  * Discover:
    * IP addresses and DNS info
    * Domain/subdomains
    * email addresses and social media profiles
